#[fluture](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fluture)
> ğŸ¦‹ Fantasy Land compliant (monadic) alternative to Promises.

Fluture offers a control structure similar to Promises, Tasks, Deferreds, and what-have-you, the lib just terms it `Futures`.

`Futures` represent the value arising from the success or failure of an asynchronous operation they are lazy and adhere to the monadic interface.
