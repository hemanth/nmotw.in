#[toposort](https://npm.im/toposort)
> Sort directed acyclic graphs

`toposort` does the topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph.

__Get it:__ `npm install toposort`

__Sample usage:__

```js
// First, we define our edges.
var graph = [
  ['put on your shoes', 'tie your shoes']
, ['put on your shirt', 'put on your jacket']
, ['put on your shorts', 'put on your jacket']
, ['put on your shorts', 'put on your shoes']
]
 
 
// Now, sort the vertices topologically, to reveal a legal execution order.
toposort(graph)
// [ 'put on your shirt'
// , 'put on your shorts'
// , 'put on your jacket'
// , 'put on your shoes'
// , 'tie your shoes' ]

```

__Sorting dependencies:__

```js
// This time, edges represent dependencies.
var graph = [
  ['tie your shoes', 'put on your shoes']
, ['put on your jacket', 'put on your shirt']
, ['put on your shoes', 'put on your shorts']
, ['put on your jacket', 'put on your shorts']
]
 
toposort(graph) 
// [ 'tie your shoes'
// , 'put on your shoes'
// , 'put on your jacket'
// , 'put on your shirt'
// , 'put on your shorts' ]
 
// Now, reversing the list will reveal a legal execution order.
toposort(graph).reverse() 
// [ 'put on your shorts'
// , 'put on your shirt'
// , 'put on your jacket'
// , 'put on your shoes'
// , 'tie your shoes' ]
```
