#[lolex](https://nmp.im/lolex)
> Fake "timers"

`lolex` useful for testing, extract from `Sinon.JS` helps to fake timer: 

* `setTimeout`
* `clearTimeout`
* `setImmediate`
* `clearImmediate`
* `setInterval`
* `clearInterval`
* `requestAnimationFrame`
* `cancelAnimationFrame`
* `requestIdleCallback`
* `cancelIdleCallback`

Along with a clock instance that controls the flow of time. Lolex also provides a `Date` implementation that gets its time from the clock.

In addition in browser environment lolex provides a `performance` implementation that gets its time from the clock. In Node environments lolex provides a `nextTick` implementation that is synchronized with the clock - and a `process.hrtime` shim that works with the clock.


__Get it:__ `npm install lolex`

__Sample usage:__

```js
let lolex = require("lolex");
let clock = lolex.createClock();
 
clock.setTimeout(function () {
    console.log("nmotw.in");
}, 15);
 
// ...
 
clock.tick(15); // nmotw.in
```

__GIF FTW!__
