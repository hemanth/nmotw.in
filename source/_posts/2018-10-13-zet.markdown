#[zet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zet)
> Set() as it should be.


`zet` is an extension of ES6 Set and comes with all its functionality included along with the below:

* ∪ union
* ∩ intersection
* - difference/subtract
* ⊖ symmetric difference
* ⊆ subset
* ⊇ superse

__Get it:__ `npm install zet`

__Sample usage:__


```js

const Zet = require('zet');

let a = new Zet([1, 2, 3]);
let b = new Zet([3, 4, 5]);
let c = new Zet([2, 3, 4]);

Zet.union(a, b);
//=> [Zet] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

a.union(b, c);
//=> [Zet] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

a.intersection(b);
//=> [Zet] {3}

a.symmetricDifference(c);
//=> [Zet] {1, 4}

a.subset(b);
//=> false
```

__GIT FTW!__
