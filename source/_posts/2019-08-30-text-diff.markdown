> HTML formatted text diff!

`text-diff` is an implementation of [diff-match-patch](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch) which is a high-performance library in multiple languages that manipulates plain text.

__Get it:__ `npm install text-diff`

__Sample usage:__

```js
const Diff = require('text-diff');
 
const diff = new Diff(); // options may be passed to constructor; see below
const textDiff = diff.main('text1', 'text2'); // produces diff array
diff.prettyHtml(textDiff); // produces a formatted HTML string
```

__GIF FTW!__
